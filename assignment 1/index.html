            <p>
                The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
                So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)<br>
                Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
                Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)<br>
                You come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)<br>
                Take my hand, stop, put "Van the Man" on the jukebox<br>
                And then we start to dance<br>
                And now I'm singing like<br>
                Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                Grab on my waist and put that body on me"<br>
                Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                Come, come on now, follow my lead (mm-mm)
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                Although my heart is falling too<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br>
                Last night you were in my room<br>
                And now my bed sheets smell like you<br>
                Every day discovering something brand new<br>
                Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                Oh, I'm in love with your body
            </p>
